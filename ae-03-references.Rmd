# Introduction

You can cite references directly in the text using the `@key`:

- The paper by *REFERENCE-1* is an important paper for week 5 of the course.

To put citations in parenthesis, you use `[@key]`:

- In your data, always write dates as YYYY-MM-DD [*REFERENCE-1*].

To cite multiple entries, seperate the keys by semicolons, [`@key-1`, `@key2`]

- A data dictionary is a seperate files from your data that describes all the variables. It is information about your data, also called metadata. [*REFERENCE-1*; *REFERENCE-2*]
